<h1>Creating Stored Procedures</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive overview of the process involved in creating a stored procedure within SQL. A stored procedure is a precompiled SQL statement that can be saved and executed as needed to streamline repetitive tasks, enhance query efficiency, and improve database management. By encapsulating frequently used commands, stored procedures enable users to automate complex operations, retrieve specific datasets, and maintain consistency across database interactions. This project highlights the advantages of stored procedures in optimizing database performance, reducing redundancy, and ensuring secure, structured access to critical data.
